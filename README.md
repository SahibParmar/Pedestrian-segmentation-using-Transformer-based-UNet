🚶‍♂️ **Pedestrian Segmentation using Transformer-based UNet (TransUNet)**
This repository contains a focused experiment using a Transformer-based UNet architecture (TransUNet) for pedestrian segmentation. The goal was to explore the architecture’s performance on a lightweight setup using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.



🧪 **What this repo demonstrates:**
TransUNet architecture built with a ResNet-50 backbone and Vision Transformer encoder.

Trained on a Kaggle pedestrian segmentation dataset (linked inside the uploaded Jupyter Notebook).

Achieved clear segmentation in very small time.



🔍 **Purpose of this repo:**
This experiment documents a small but notable insight—TransUNet’s fast convergence and decent performance on simple pedestrian segmentation. Although it wasn’t integrated into the final ReID pipeline, the result can be useful for prototyping or academic exploration.
